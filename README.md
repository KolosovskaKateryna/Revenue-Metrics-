# Revenue-Metrics-
Goal: To create an interactive dashboard for analysing cash flow dynamics, paying user behaviour, and factors affecting revenue growth or decline.

# Functionality
Analysis of key metrics: MRR, ARPPU, Paid/New/Churned Users, Churn Rate, Revenue Churn Rate, Expansion MRR, Contraction MRR, LTV, LT.
Analysis of reasons for revenue changes (new, lost, and returning users)
Filters by date, language and user age

# Tech stack
DBeaver  - data aggregation and preparation
Tableau - dashboard and visualisation creation

# Tasks
Prepared data using SQL queries (aggregation by month, user, revenue, query contains three CTEs, and final query that combines two tables);
Calculated key metrics (MRR, ARPPU, Paid/New/Churned Users, Churn Rate, Revenue Churn Rate, Expansion MRR, Contraction MRR, LTV, LT);
Built a set of visualisations in Tableau that show the change in these indicators over time.

# What has been done
Six graphs were created for the dashboard:
Revenue Change Factors — shows which factors (new, churned, expansion, contraction) influenced the change in revenue.
Paid Users Change Factors — shows user growth and loss by month.
Churn Rate & Revenue Churn Rate — reflect the level of user and revenue loss.
Total Paid Users & Total MRR — overall dynamics of paid users and regular revenue.
ARPPU — average revenue per paying user.
LT & LTV — user lifetime and their value to the project.

 # Conclusions after working on the project

* The dashboard allows you to quickly see the main trends in revenue and users.
* With its help, you can determine in which months MRR is growing or falling, and what influenced this — new users, returns, or losses.
* The project helped me gain a deeper understanding of the business metrics of SaaS projects and the analytical capabilities of Tableau.
